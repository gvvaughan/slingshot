Slingshot NEWS - User visible changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]


* Noteworthy changes in release 5 (2013-12-08) [stable]

** New Features:

  - The announcement message is formatted for easier pasting into
    github release notes.
  - Mkrockspecs sorts table keys in generated rockspecs, so that
    contents of build.modules is in order, for example.
  - Travis builds will now use the latest upstream luarocks 2.1.1
    release.

** Bugs fixed:

  - Specifying additional SPECL_OPTS in local.mk now works properly.
  - Announcement message shows luarocks install command correctly.
  - Travis builds now use the correct version of Lua for local
    luarocks installation, so compiled dependency rocks actually
    work.
  - Fixed a typo in maint.mk no-submodule-changes rule.


* Noteworthy changes in release 4 (2013-08-29) [stable]

** New Features:

  - mkrockspecs uses luaposix to search the module root tree for lua
    sources if it is available, which is a lot faster than spawning
    a shell to list the contents of each subdirectory, and reading the
    results back over a pipe.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Submodules pulled to the release branch are removed before unpacking
    the release tarball.
  - `make syntax-check` ignores submodule directories.
  - Scm rockspecs are now correctly copied to the release branch.
  - No longer leaves trailing whitespace in .travis.yml where there are
    no additional luarocks to install.
  - No longer reinstalls the slingshot client package on Travis.
  - Fixed many fine typos.


* Noteworthy changes in release 3 (2013-05-19) [stable]

** New Features:

  - Support Specl automation with `include build-aux/specl.mk`

  - No longer using hobbled "foreign" mode.  README is distributed
    in release tarballs, but README.md maintained in the repo for
    prettier output on github.

  - Support `--module-dir ROOT` option to `mkrockspecs` to
    specify the root of a tree of `.lua` files for a LuaRocks
    "builtin" build.type installation.  Pass the new option to
    Slingshot mkrockspec invocations setting `mkrockspecs_args`
    appropriately in your `local.mk`:

      mkrockspecs_args = --module-dir lib

  - Works with lyaml 4 and newer, which now returns all documents
    in the YAML stream as a table.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Don't forget to distribute .autom4te.cfg file.

  - If either luadoc or ldoc are specified in SS_CONFIG_TRAVIS,
    perform a segregated 5.1 install with the system luarocks to
    avoid incompatibilities on Travis CI.

** Incompatible Changes:

  - `mail` wrapper removed.  Rockspec announcement sent with a link
    to the rockspec rather than as an attachment.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** New Features:

  - No longer depend on `woger`.
  - New `mail` wrapper script to provide a POSIX mail API wrapped
    around mutt.  Currently Mac OS X specific (which is the main
    system that doesn't ship a POSIX mail compatible command).
  - Split local and origin rules to support, eg:
      $ make beta
      ...manually check local trees...
      $ make push
      ...manually check github zipball and released rockspec files...
      ...maunally edit ~/announce-<package>-<version>...
      $ make mail
  - Port of gnulib project sanity checks hooked into release
    rules by `include build-aux/sanity.mk`.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Newly created release branch is now branched from the v1 tag rather
    than the "Post-release administrivia" commit.
  - Include maintainer support files in release, so that Travis CI has
    everything it needs to work on the release branch too.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** Initial proof-of concept for shared Lua RockSpec framework.
