Slingshot NEWS - User visible changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 7 (2014-07-31) [stable]

** New Features:

  - Slingshot `make release` now requires a LuaRocks binary that supports
    the upload command (such as the 2.2.0 beta release) and uses that to
    upload rockspecs directly to the moonrocks repository, rather than
    emailing the luarocks-developer list with an upload request.  If the
    upload fails due to a missing api-key, then make sure you have one
    at rocks.moonscript.org/settings and call make like this:

        make upload API_KEY=0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDE

  - `mkrockspecs` accepts a new `--branch` option for generating a
    git/scm rockspec that pulls that branch instead of master.

  - `mkrockspecs` accepts a new `--repository` option to cope with
    releasing a LuaRock from a repository with a different name, e.g:
    `stdlib-36-1.rockspec` from `http://github.com/rrthomas/lua-stdlib`.

  - Slingshot bootstrap will check rockspecs listed in $buildreq,
    according to the URL part of a specification-triple ending in
    `.rockspec`.  So that we don't have to install, say, LDoc twice for
    Travis (once in the system rocks tree so that bootstrap won't bomb
    out with a missing rockspec error, and then again in the project
    rocks tree after luarocks-config.ld has been built by make), the
    rockspec version checks can be short-circuited by setting an APPVAR
    in bootstrap's environment, e.g:

        LDOC=`pwd`/luarocks/bin/ldoc ./bootstrap

  - Slingshot bootstrap accepts a new `--luarocks-tree` option to
    check a particular tree for prerequisite rocks.

  - `build-aux/merge-sections` has a new `--verbose` flag that reports
    progress to stderr in real time.

  - Remove m4/ax_compare_version.m4 and dependencies, resulting in a
    slightly faster and smaller configure.

** Bugs fixed:

  - `bootstrap` now has `slingshot_copy` merged in correctly.

  - `mkrockspecs` generates build.modules keys correctly for the
    `foo/bar/init.lua` pattern.


* Noteworthy changes in release 6 (2014-01-04) [stable]

** New Features:

  - A manually entered list of modules in rockspec.conf now
    creates "builtin" autoconfless builds in the main rockspec
    just as if --module-dir had been passed.
  - Support running `make check` on installed packages, where the
    checks require access to resources not visible in the install
    tree (e.g. installed specl has all lua sources inlined, rather
    than in an installed subtree, but unit tests need access to the
    module subtree which is only visible in the build directory).

** Incompatible Changes:

  - `bootstrap.slingshot` is now automatically merged into the
    `bootstrap` script, so you shouldn't copy it into your project
    tree anymore, or add the glue to run it to your `bootstrap.conf`.

* Noteworthy changes in release 5 (2013-12-08) [stable]

** New Features:

  - The announcement message is formatted for easier pasting into
    github release notes.
  - Mkrockspecs sorts table keys in generated rockspecs, so that
    contents of build.modules is in order, for example.
  - Travis builds will now use the latest upstream luarocks 2.1.1
    release.

** Bugs fixed:

  - Specifying additional SPECL_OPTS in local.mk now works properly.
  - Announcement message shows luarocks install command correctly.
  - Travis builds now use the correct version of Lua for local
    luarocks installation, so compiled dependency rocks actually
    work.
  - Fixed a typo in maint.mk no-submodule-changes rule.


* Noteworthy changes in release 4 (2013-08-29) [stable]

** New Features:

  - mkrockspecs uses luaposix to search the module root tree for lua
    sources if it is available, which is a lot faster than spawning
    a shell to list the contents of each subdirectory, and reading the
    results back over a pipe.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Submodules pulled to the release branch are removed before unpacking
    the release tarball.
  - `make syntax-check` ignores submodule directories.
  - Scm rockspecs are now correctly copied to the release branch.
  - No longer leaves trailing whitespace in .travis.yml where there are
    no additional luarocks to install.
  - No longer reinstalls the slingshot client package on Travis.
  - Fixed many fine typos.


* Noteworthy changes in release 3 (2013-05-19) [stable]

** New Features:

  - Support Specl automation with `include build-aux/specl.mk`

  - No longer using hobbled "foreign" mode.  README is distributed
    in release tarballs, but README.md maintained in the repo for
    prettier output on github.

  - Support `--module-dir ROOT` option to `mkrockspecs` to
    specify the root of a tree of `.lua` files for a LuaRocks
    "builtin" build.type installation.  Pass the new option to
    Slingshot mkrockspec invocations setting `mkrockspecs_args`
    appropriately in your `local.mk`:

      mkrockspecs_args = --module-dir lib

  - Works with lyaml 4 and newer, which now returns all documents
    in the YAML stream as a table.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Don't forget to distribute .autom4te.cfg file.

  - If either luadoc or ldoc are specified in SS_CONFIG_TRAVIS,
    perform a segregated 5.1 install with the system luarocks to
    avoid incompatibilities on Travis CI.

** Incompatible Changes:

  - `mail` wrapper removed.  Rockspec announcement sent with a link
    to the rockspec rather than as an attachment.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** New Features:

  - No longer depend on `woger`.
  - New `mail` wrapper script to provide a POSIX mail API wrapped
    around mutt.  Currently Mac OS X specific (which is the main
    system that doesn't ship a POSIX mail compatible command).
  - Split local and origin rules to support, eg:
      $ make beta
      ...manually check local trees...
      $ make push
      ...manually check github zipball and released rockspec files...
      ...maunally edit ~/announce-<package>-<version>...
      $ make mail
  - Port of gnulib project sanity checks hooked into release
    rules by `include build-aux/sanity.mk`.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Newly created release branch is now branched from the v1 tag rather
    than the "Post-release administrivia" commit.
  - Include maintainer support files in release, so that Travis CI has
    everything it needs to work on the release branch too.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** Initial proof-of concept for shared Lua RockSpec framework.
