Slingshot NEWS - User visible changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

** New Features:

  - Support Specl automation with `include build-aux/specl.mk`

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Don't forget to distribute README.md and .autom4te.cfg files.

** Incompatible Changes:

  - `mail` wrapper removed.  Rockspec announcement sent with a link
    to the rockspec rather than as an attachment.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** New Features:

  - No longer depend on `woger`.
  - New `mail` wrapper script to provide a POSIX mail API wrapped
    around mutt.  Currently Mac OS X specific (which is the main
    system that doesn't ship a POSIX mail compatible command).
  - Split local and origin rules to support, eg:
      $ make beta
      ...manually check local trees...
      $ make push
      ...manually check github zipball and released rockspec files...
      ...maunally edit ~/announce-<package>-<version>...
      $ make mail
  - Port of gnulib project sanity checks hooked into release
    rules by `include build-aux/sanity.mk`.

** Bugs Fixed:

  - Newly created release branch is now branched from the v1 tag rather
    than the "Post-release administrivia" commit.
  - Include maintainer support files in release, so that Travis CI has
    everything it needs to work on the release branch too.

* Noteworthy changes in release 1 (2013-04-28) [beta]

** Initial proof-of concept for shared Lua RockSpec framework.
